    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>It all started with an outlet at Tariq Road in 2002. At that time, Tariq Road was, and still is, a shopping hub for
    those who seek to buy the latest in fashion. Initially, only men's wear was available at the store, but later on
    clothing for women, children, teens, as well as formal wear including groom's wear was also added to the product
    list as expansion continued. In 2011, we took another bold initiative and gave a new look to all our outlets as part
    of our ‘New Outlook, New Outlet' strategy. This broke the monotonous theme of our outlets by making them more modern
    and different from others.</p>

    <h2>Corporate Philosophy</h2>

    <p>The main idea behind launching J. (J dot) was to reintroduce traditional clothes in Pakistan with a blend of
    modernism. For this purpose, we initiated with reworking on our Eastern dresses, especially Qameez Shalwar and made
    them contemporary with the latest elaborations available. The experimentation with this rare combination resulted in
    an increased interest of people toward modified Eastern ensembles, which will always be in vogue.</p>

    <p>J. can be defined as a fashion retail brand that is rich, elegant and stylish in traditional ensembles. It keeps
    adding seasonal clothes, machine prints, intricate embroidery and modern cuts to its already extensive collection on

    fashion professionals who come from the country's renowned fashion institutes. They start out by studying the latest
    trends, carrying out research on how these trends can be adopted, selecting the colors and styles that can make the
    collection extraordinary and then finalizing both casual and formal designs for every season.</p>

    <h2>Innovation</h2>

    <p>Though the philosophy behind establishing J.Was ti revive our traditional Qameez Shalwar. the aspect of adding a
    modern touch to them is what makes this brand exclusive. This rare combination of blending tradition with the latest
    fashion trends is itself innovative as it give rise to astonishingly amazing designs. This makes the brand a trend
    setter in the fashion industry. For impeccable finesse. we use state-of-the-art technology for weaving our own
